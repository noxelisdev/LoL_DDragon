# _League of Legends_ - Data Dragon

Do you want to use DDragon for an another game from _Riot Games_? Check the _Data Dragon_ repository for [_2XKO_](https://github.com/InFinity54/2XKO_DDragon), [_Legends of Runeterra_](https://github.com/InFinity54/LoR_DDragon), or [_Valorant_](https://github.com/InFinity54/Valorant_DDragon). _Teamfight Tactics_ data is now included in this repository.

## Introduction
_Data Dragon_ is a package of files you can use for your projects about [_League of Legends_](https://www.leagueoflegends.com), distributed by Riot Games. A new version of Data Dragon is released some days after each game update. This repository allows you to update automatically all files more easily.

Don't forget that new patchs will be added right after their release on Riot Games' Developers website, but it takes often many days to come.

Since patch 13.12.1 and set 9 release for _Teamfight Tactics_, this repository is also containing data from _Teamfight Tactics_.

In January 2025, with start of the 15th season of _League_, _Riot_ decided to change the way patchs are named. This repository will not reflect this change, because _Riot_ did not reflect it in _Data Dragon_'s files too. You can find more information about this in the "Patchs added to this repository for the current season" of this document. This change has been partially reverted on February 19th: changes will appear here too, in README, but not in repository.

## Unused contents in this repository
Because of the presence of all previous patchs (which can still be downloaded from Riot Games servers), some contents which became unused in _League of Legends_ are available in this repository. This content can be some deleted elements, or old versions of actual stuff. In the repository, you will find :

- Old runes and masteries, deleted from the game since patch 7.22 (November 8th, 2017)
- Some items icons that was previously removed from the game
- Minimap from old games modes or previous temporary games modes
- Old items icons, before the remastering of in-game shop and the remastering of all items of the game of patch 10.23, for the preseason 11 (patch released on November 11th, 2020)

## Additional notes
- Others problems has been reported to Riot Games, and you can find all of them (and the 3 above too) in the [Riot Games' Developer Relations Bug Tracking about League of Legends' Data Dragon](https://github.com/RiotGames/developer-relations/labels/topic%3A%20ddrag%20lol).
- Starting patch 13.10.1, Vietnamese language code has been changed by Riot from `vn_VN` to `vi_VN`. The `vn_VN` files has been moved to the `vi_VN` folder, including unused data. This has been [announced by Riot on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RiotGamesDevRel/status/1658949539867271171).

## Patchs added to this repository for the current season
This list contains patchs from actual season. For all previous patchs of all previous seasons, you can check [OLDPATCHS.md](OLDPATCHS.md).

**IMPORTANT NOTE: _Riot_ decided to change the way patchs are named since the start of the 15th season. Please note that this repository will not reflect this change, because _Riot_ did not reflect it either in files provided for the _League of Legends Data Dragon_. This can be explained by _Teamfight Tactics_, which is included in these files, keeping the old name system. The first patch of the 15th season will be named 25.S1.1 for _LoL_ and 15.1 for _TFT_. This README will contain both names, but Git tags and repository files will keep the old naming system.**
